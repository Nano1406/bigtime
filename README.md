## A little bit of history

One day, a friend of mine ask me for an app and said me something like "I want to play a track and see the time as big as possible on the screen of my phone". He's musician and he need to follow a track not by the score but for the time. So, he want to load a track to play and follow it by the "clock". His first approach was load the track and synchronized a timer. The problem with that approach was the size of the timer, it was too tiny.&nbsp;

The same night, I started to think the first approaches to the app. The next day, I sent him the link to the first version. He was happy but I knew that I wanted to work a little bit more on it.

### Dev Stuffs

In this repo you can find a few different branches. There are two principal and some others are little improvements over the principal ones.&nbsp;

I started in the Master branch applying my react knowledge until that moment. So there you will found Class Components mixed with Functional Components. Until that moment, I had never used React Hooks.&nbsp;

Next I created a new branch call "hook-refactor". Here I started to convert all Class Components to Functional Components and started to use React Hooks. For some time I was looking some excuse to use and learn this new feature of React, so I don't miss the opportunity. I didn't have the need to use any custom hook so you only found useState and useEffect. In this branch I also added a lot of functionality to the app. Login flow with FirebaseAuth was one of those.

<!-- ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
